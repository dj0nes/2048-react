## About

As of writing (Mar 2021) this is a mashup of code from when I was first learning react, and updates I have made since.

There's still quite a bit of old-style stuff around, like `Object.assign` where nowadays I'd use `{...spread}`.

There's also a ton of duplication in tests. Will get around to DRYing that up... eventually.
